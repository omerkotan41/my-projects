## Welcome to my "Python Bootcamp" project repository! 

This repository contains all the projects I completed during my Python learning journey. While the projects started as exercises from the course, I did not simply copy the original scripts. Instead, I enhanced and extended them using my own ideas and improvements. 
Each project demonstrates my ability to take a basic concept and develop it further, showcasing different skills from basic Python syntax to more advanced topics such as data structures, algorithms, and interactive scripts.  

These projects reflect my personal approach to problem-solving, creativity in coding, and growth as a Python developer.
