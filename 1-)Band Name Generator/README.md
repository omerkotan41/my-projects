# Band Name Generator  

## Overview  
This is a Band Name Generator project implemented in Python. The project allows users to generate creative band names based on user input. It started as a simple course project and was extended with additional features for more flexibility and creativity.  

The original course version asks for your hometown and petâ€™s name to generate a single band name. My version improves upon it by allowing multiple words and generating all possible permutations of the entered words, providing a wider variety of band name options.  

## Features  
- Interactive user input for city, animal, and custom words.  
- Option to choose how many words the band name should consist of.  
- Generates all possible permutations of the input words for unique band name ideas.  
- Handles both two-word and three-word band name generation dynamically.
